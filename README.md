## Why SnapFetch?

Snap-Fetch is a lightweight data fetching tool for React applications. It's designed to efficiently fetch data from APIs, cache it, and store it in Redux using Redux Toolkit and Redux Saga. Snap-Fetch provides intuitive hooks for performing queries and mutations, as well as configuring global API options.

**"By the way I built Snap-Fetch to address common challenges in modern web applications when dealing with API requests. Here's why I created it:**

1. **Efficiency**: Snap-Fetch reduces unnecessary network requests by intelligently caching data and avoiding duplicate fetches for the same information.
2. **Simplicity**: It provides easy-to-use hooks for queries and mutations, simplifying the process of fetching and updating data.
3. **Performance**: By avoiding unnecessary re-renders and managing cache lifetimes, Snap-Fetch helps improve overall application performance.
4. **Redux Integration**: It seamlessly integrates with Redux, leveraging Redux Toolkit and Redux Saga for state management and side-effect handling.
5. **Flexibility**: Snap-Fetch allows for custom configurations, including the ability to use custom fetch functions and set global API options.
6. **Built-in Features**: It includes useful features like caching, invalidation, polling, and pagination support out of the box.

- By creating Snap-Fetch, I aimed to streamline the data fetching process in React applications, making it more efficient and developer-friendly while addressing common pain points in API interactions."
